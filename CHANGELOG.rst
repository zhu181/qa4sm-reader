- Added function to retrieve the package version

Version 0.9
===========
- QA4SM release 2 version
- Status maps and box plots
- FRM box plots added
- Scaling reference units used on plots
- SMOS and SMAP L2 added

Version 0.8

- Code formatting established (through yapf and pep8)

Version 0.7.3
=============
- Fix bug in metadata plots download; improves some graphics

Version 0.7.2
=============
- Modified to generate mapplots from SMOS L3 as reference. Includes small change in metadata plots labels.

Version 0.7.1
=============
- Add alternative dataset names

Version 0.7
===========
- Added a new dataset to the reader (SMOS L3), including functions to deal with missing datasets specifications (version name, units, ..)

Version 0.6.4
=============
- Added a new dataset to the reader (SMOS L3), including functions to deal with missing datasets specifications (version name, units, ..)

Version 0.6.3
